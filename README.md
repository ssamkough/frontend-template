# nextjs template

this is the template i use for whenever i want to use nextjs for a project

i always catch myself manually doing these things so might as well make it easier for myself

## steps

1. clone this repo

2. install dependcies: `yarn`

3. run: `yarn dev`

## info

the base of this was created with by running `yarn create next-app --typescript` (as of september 2022) ([source](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript#create-next-app-support))

then i added my own things like my own styles, libraries (e.g. `styled-components`, `prettier`), and some more
